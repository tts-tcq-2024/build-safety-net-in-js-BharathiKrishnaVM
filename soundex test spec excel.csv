Test Case 1: Basic Soundex Code Generation
    Input: "Robert"
    Expected Output: "R163"
    Description: Verify that the Soundex code for "Robert" is correctly generated.

Test Case 2: Similar Sounding Names
    Input: "Rupert"
    Expected Output: "R163"
    Description: Ensure that "Rupert" generates the same Soundex code as "Robert".

Test Case 3: Different Names
    Input: "John"
    Expected Output: "J530"
    Description: Check that "John" produces the expected Soundex code.

Test Case 4: Handling Special Characters
    Input: "O'Reilly"
    Expected Output: "O640"
    Description: Verify that the algorithm correctly processes names with apostrophes.

Test Case 5: Empty String Input
    Input: ""
    Expected Output: ""
    Description: Ensure that an empty input returns an empty Soundex code.

Test Case 6: Numeric Input
    Input: "12345"
    Expected Output: ""
    Description: Check that numeric input results in an empty output.

Test Case 7: Trim additional spaces
    Input: " Smith "
    Expected Output: "S530"
    Description: Verify the spaces are ignored.

Test Case 8: Multi-Word Input
    Input: "Van Der Meer"
    Expected Output: "V535"
    Description: Check that the Soundex algorithm handles multi-word names correctly.

Test Case 9: Repeated Characters
    Input: "Bobby"
    Expected Output: "B010"
    Description: Ensure that the Soundex code correctly reflects repeated characters.

Test Case 10: All Vowels
    Input: "Aeiou"
    Expected Output: "A000"
    Description: Verify that a name consisting solely of vowels returns a Soundex code of "A000".

Test Case 11: Mixed Case
    Input: "john"
    Expected Output: "J530"
    Description: Ensure that case variations do not affect the Soundex output.

Test Case 12: Long Input Handling
    Input: "Alexander"
    Expected Output: "A425"
    Description: Check that longer names produce the expected Soundex code.

Test Case 13: Phonetically Similar Names
    Input: "Smith" and "Smyth"
    Expected Output: Both should return "S530"
    Description: Verify that phonetically similar names generate the same Soundex code.

Test Case 14: Names with Numbers
    Input: "Mary 123"
    Expected Output: "M640"
    Description: Ensure that numbers within names do not affect the Soundex output.
